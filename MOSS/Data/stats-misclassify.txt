        bubble2632666: contains insertion sort fun also
        bubble3275457: implements insertion sort also
        bubble1299882: flag & malloc
        bubble3853986: lot of jargons in code like malloc, assert, memset, fgetc, isdigit, continue etc
        bubble2362106: flag, counters
        bubble2633703: flag, counters

        bubble2928707: learnt it wrong (similar to top uses flag)
        bubble4434530: uses flag

        bubble3537305: pointer indexing instead of array
    Quick:1
        bubble2529536: Code contains unusual data types and like uint16_t some modifiers like PRIu8

    Selection: 3
        merge1515388: Maybe because of sort function (it doesn't require swap at all)
        merge2128156: mymalloc #define 
        merge4152567: jargons like mypr fun, getchar_unlocked, #if etc

        merge1794400: nothing wrong
    Quick: 6
        merge3750272: wrong code (used qsort and some fun f to count)
        merge4029017: fine except #define
